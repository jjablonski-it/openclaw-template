# 2026-02-22

- User preference confirmed: always respond in English only.
- User requested accommodation research for morning: Booking + Airbnb options in/around Sirmione.
- New standing engineering rule from user: prefer durable, generic, no-hacks configuration; build setups as long-term maintainable defaults.
- Migrated canonical state dir naming from `/data/.clawdbot` to `/data/.openclaw` with compatibility symlink for legacy references.
- Operational preference: on this template, each GitHub push triggers gateway rebuild; therefore push should be the final action after all changes are complete.
- Railway CLI auth persistence hardened: moved config to `/data/.openclaw/credentials/railway` and symlinked `/root/.railway` -> persistent path.
- Standing rule reinforced: all setup must survive restarts (persist state/auth/config paths under `/data`).
- Implemented bootstrap persistence wiring for GH CLI, Railway CLI, npm, pnpm, and Homebrew caches under `/data/.openclaw/credentials/*`.
- Added token-first guidance for rebuild-proof auth: prefer `GH_TOKEN` and `RAILWAY_TOKEN` env vars with least privilege.
- New operating rule from user: for complex tasks, always ask clarifying/double-check questions first when there is any ambiguity (e.g., guest count) before running long searches.
