# 2026-02-24

- User preference added: don't assume awareness of internal ecosystem tools; mention systems like ClawHub when relevant.
- Removed local fallback skill 'find-skills' and installed 'self-improving-agent' from ClawHub.
- New communication rule: for project topics, log decisions in dedicated Discord project channels even if discussion happened in another chat first.
- Routing preference confirmed: DM for control/meta; project execution in dedicated channels. If discussed in DM, mirror actionable summary in project channel.
- Autonomy preference: proactive ideas/plans/updates are desired.
- Safety boundary reiterated: no production pushes or user-impacting changes without explicit approval.
- Improvement preference refined: prioritize wider, high-impact optimizations; avoid repeating nightly memory-only tweaks.

- Daily note initialized.
- Daily optimization review: identified repeatable friction from missing daily notes in cron contexts.
- Improved `scripts/memory-bootstrap.sh` to idempotently ensure both UTC today and UTC yesterday memory files exist (not just today), reducing ENOENT failures for routines that read both days.
- Memory hygiene: promoted hard safety preference to long-term `MEMORY.md` (no prod push/settings/DB migrations without explicit approval).
- Verification: ran bootstrap script successfully; confirmed today/yesterday + MEMORY presence.
