- Daily note initialized.
- Daily optimization review: identified repeatable friction from missing daily notes in cron contexts.
- Improved `scripts/memory-bootstrap.sh` to idempotently ensure both UTC today and UTC yesterday memory files exist (not just today), reducing ENOENT failures for routines that read both days.
- Memory hygiene: promoted hard safety preference to long-term `MEMORY.md` (no prod push/settings/DB migrations without explicit approval).
- Verification: ran bootstrap script successfully; confirmed today/yesterday + MEMORY presence.
