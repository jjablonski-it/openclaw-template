# 2026-02-23

- Hard safety boundary from user: no production push, no production settings changes, and no DB updates/migrations without explicit approval.

- Ran daily optimization review.
- Added `scripts/memory-bootstrap.sh` to remove repeatable friction where daily cron/tasks fail on missing `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `MEMORY.md`.
- Verified durability/idempotency: script creates files once and safely no-ops on re-run.
- Initialized `MEMORY.md` with durable user preferences already confirmed in prior notes.
- Session-history review was limited in this cron context (only current cron session visible).
