# 2026-02-25

- Added Discord #work channel (1476156956396752917) as dedicated work session surface.
- Routing intent: work-related discussion should happen in #work with separate context from project channels.
- Email safety rule confirmed: never send emails via gog unless explicitly requested in that moment; drafts/organization can proceed.
