# 2026-02-25

- Daily note initialized.
- Daily optimization review completed.
- Implemented `scripts/daily-optimization-preflight.sh` to remove repeatable friction where review runs without required context files.
- Preflight now bootstraps daily memory files, verifies `SOUL.md` / `USER.md` / `MEMORY.md` + UTC today/yesterday notes, and fails fast if anything is missing.
- Verification: script executed successfully and reported preflight OK.
- Memory hygiene check: no new durable user preferences/decisions found beyond existing `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` entries.
