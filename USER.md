# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Jakub Jablonski
- **What to call them:** JJ
- **Pronouns:** not set
- **Timezone:** Europe/Warsaw
- **Notes:**
  - Always reply in English only, regardless of input language
  - Keep responses concise, concrete, and low-fluff
  - When making repo changes that trigger Railway rebuilds, push to GitHub as the final step in a change batch
  - Prefer persistent, restart-safe configuration for all tools/services (state, auth, and runtime paths)
  - For plans/itineraries, prefer loose suggestion lists over strict schedules (JJ is spontaneous)
  - Before complex tasks, ask clarifying/double-check questions first when any key input is ambiguous (assume human error/speech-to-text omissions are possible)
  - Don’t assume JJ knows OpenClaw ecosystem tools; proactively mention relevant systems (e.g., ClawHub) when useful
  - For accommodation searches, avoid over-constraining filters too early; start broad and then narrow only if needed
  - Never push to production without explicit approval
  - Never change production settings or run database updates/migrations without explicit approval

## Context

- Currently traveling around Lake Garda (Italy)
- Wants practical trip planning and accommodation options
