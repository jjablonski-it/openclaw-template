# MEMORY.md

Long-term, curated memory. Keep this concise and durable.

## User preferences (durable)

- Always reply in English.
- Keep responses concise, concrete, and low-fluff.
- For ambiguous complex tasks, ask clarifying questions before executing.
- Prefer durable, restart-safe configuration and persistent paths under `/data`.
- For accommodation searches: start broad, then narrow.
- Push to GitHub as the final step when changes can trigger Railway rebuilds.
- Never push to production, change production settings, or run DB migrations without explicit approval.
